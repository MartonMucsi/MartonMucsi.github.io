    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to demonstrate my skills in webdesign. I have so far learned a bit of html5, css3, JS, and some of the frameworks associated with them, i.e. Boostrap for frontend and JSON</p>
    <p>Here's a few examples of my work and first:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My first encounter with html and css: The Anakin webpage. Got this exercise from a short coding camp. Nothing complicated yet, but stylish.</li>
        <li>My first encounter with JS: a simple webapp for viewing pictures. I know, there are probably tons of ready-to-use code snippets for this, but I learned quite a lot while building it from scratch.</li>
        <li>Now here is a more complicated site: the webpage of the Fictional Burger shop.</li>
        <li>The page you're looking at rigth now is also built from scratch, using Bootstrap for nicer appearance.</li>
    </ul>
